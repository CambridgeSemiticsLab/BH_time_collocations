"""
Find substantives that should have a separator 
between them and a subsequent substantive according
to the Tiberian accents.

One can think of it like an "invisible" conjunction.
These patterns are especially frequent in lists.
For example:

    "Shem Ham and Japheth"

Here we want to insert a separator between "Shem" and
"Ham" so that the parser knows these are separate and
not an apposition relation. This requires semantic knowledge.

We harvest some of this knowledge from the Tiberian accents.
First we find all such cases of side-by-side substantives.
Then we identify whether the first substantive has a disjunctive
accent or not. If it does, we add it to a list.
