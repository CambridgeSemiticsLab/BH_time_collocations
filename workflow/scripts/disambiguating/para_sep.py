"""
Find substantives that should have a separator 
between them and a subsequent substantive according
to the ETCBC's BHSA.

One can think of it like an "invisible" conjunction.
These patterns are especially frequent in lists.
For example:

    "Shem Ham and Japheth"

Here we want to insert a separator between "Shem" and
"Ham" so that the parser knows these are separate and
not an apposition relation. This requires semantic knowledge.

We harvest some of this knowledge from the ETCBC subphrase,
which has a relation called `par`. Though the subphrases
are not very reliable, they are very useful for this particular
use-case. We run a query to find all such transitions between
substantives, and store a "separator" on the first word.
i.e. in the example above, on "Shem".
