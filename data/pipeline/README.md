# Data Pipeline

This pipeline runs on `snakemake`. The entry point is the `Snakemake` file in this directory. This file, in turn, executes scripts stored in the `scripts` directory.

For details on snakemake, read the [docs](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

The output of the pipeline is stored under the `/data/data` directory.
