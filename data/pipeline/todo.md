# TODO for pipeline

## Brainstorming new data requirements:
* restrict to indicative contexts (exclude modal, gnomic, irrealis)
* exclude all poetry, restrict to prophetic / narrative texts
    * do in 2 steps: (1) restrict by book, (2) restrict to synvar genres: {prose, prophetic}
    * keep: Gen, Ex, Lev, Num, Deut, Josh, Judg, Sam, Kings, Isa, Jer, Ezek, Twelve
* ensure clause dependency labels
